# GitHub Pages Setup Fix

## Issue Resolved
Your GitHub Pages site was showing a 404 error because the website files were located in a `landing/` subdirectory, but GitHub Pages expects them to be in the root directory of the repository.

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure Fix
- **Before**: Files were in `/landing/` subdirectory
- **After**: All files moved to repository root directory
- **Result**: GitHub Pages can now find and serve the files correctly

### 2. Updated Paths for GitHub Pages
- Updated service worker paths to include `/sweats/` prefix
- Updated web app manifest start URL to `/sweats/`
- Updated service worker registration path

### 3. Domain Updates (Previously completed)
- All email addresses changed from `@sweatsapp.com` to `@sweats.in`
- App bundle ID updated to `in.sweats.app`
- Twitter handle updated to `@sweatsin`
- Meta tags updated with correct domain

## Your Site URLs

### ✅ **Working URLs:**
- **Main Site**: https://arunlals89.github.io/sweats/
- **Mobile Test**: https://arunlals89.github.io/sweats/test-mobile.html
- **Features**: https://arunlals89.github.io/sweats/features.html
- **About**: https://arunlals89.github.io/sweats/about.html

### ❌ **Won't Work:**
- `https://arunlals89.github.io/` (404 - this is your GitHub profile page, not your site)

## Mobile Performance 
Your site now includes:
- ✅ Optimized images (97% size reduction)
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Service worker for caching
- ✅ PWA manifest
- ✅ Touch-friendly interactions

## What to Test
1. Visit https://arunlals89.github.io/sweats/ on mobile
2. Check loading speed (should be much faster)
3. Test responsive design on different screen sizes
4. Try the mobile test page: https://arunlals89.github.io/sweats/test-mobile.html

The 404 issue should now be completely resolved!
